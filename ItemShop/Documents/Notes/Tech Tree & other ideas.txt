Generic items are basically trash in the sense that you want to just slap them on to the shelves and let them sell. Goblins can take any generic items crafted and put them onto shelves, barrels, etc. Craftspeople can even do it themselves. Special unique items however will require your attention.


Build an expansion to the shop for each Craftsgoblin specialist. Add additional structures / tools to give them specializations and bonuses.
Special tools, etc, can unlock new types of crafted items, or give them a sweet bonus of some kind. They also can unlock items by doing research or gaining levels. 

Maybe craftsgoblins can craft a random special item / random keywords / random rairity.


Find a good way of identifying items. We like the idea of browsing through a list of items, searching for any gems.

Also, a way to trash or recycle items would be cool. Scrap items for basic resources could be a craftsgoblin task.
